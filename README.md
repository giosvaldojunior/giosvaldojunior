# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Giosvaldo Junior

ðŸŽ“ Undergraduate student in **Economics** at the University of BrasÃ­lia (UnB), expected graduation in Dec 2025.  
ðŸ“Š Research Assistant at **FGV IBRE** (Fiscal Policy & Budget Center) and at **LAMFO/UnB** (Machine Learning Lab in Finance & Organizations).  
ðŸ“š Interested in **macroeconomics, econometrics, fiscal policy, and public finance**.  

I have some experience with R, Python, LaTeX, EViews, and Stata, mainly for econometric applications, data cleaning, and web scraping. I enjoy learning new tools as I go, especially when they help me work with large datasets. Beyond the technical side, I am interested in how economic research can inform policy debates, and I see coding as a way to make these analyses clearer and more useful.
